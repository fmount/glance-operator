# glance-operator

A Kubernetes Operator built using the [Operator Framework for Go](https://github.com/operator-framework).
The Operator provides a way to install and manage the OpenStack Glance component
on Kubernetes.

## Deployment

The operator is intended to be deployed via [OLM Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/olm-integration/quickstart-bundle).

For development purposes, it can be deployed using [install_yamls](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls) project.

```
# clone the install_yamls repository
git clone https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls

# move to the install_yamls directory
cd install_yamls

# one time operation to initialize PVs within the CRC VM, required by glance to start
make crc_storage

# Install Glance Operator using OLM (defaults to quay.io/openstack-k8s-operators)
make glance GLANCE_IMG=quay.io/openstack-k8s-operators/glance-operator-index:latest

# Deploy Glance
make glance_deploy
```

## Example: configure Glance with Ceph backend

The Glance spec API can be used to configure and customize the Ceph backend. In
particular, the presence of the cephBackend data structure has the effect of
creating an override in the glance config, adding rbd as default backend
parameter. The global `cephBackend` parameter is used to specify the Ceph
client-related "key/value" pairs required to connect the service with an
external Ceph cluster. Multiple external Ceph clusters are not supported at the
moment. The following represents an example of Glance resource that can be used
to trigger the service deployment, and enable the rbd backend that points to an
external Ceph cluster.

```
apiVersion: glance.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: GlanceAPI
metadata:
  name: glance
spec:
  serviceUser: glance
  containerImage: quay.io/tripleotraincentos8/centos-binary-glance-api:current-tripleo
  customServiceConfig: |
    [DEFAULT]
    debug = true
  databaseInstance: openstack
  databaseUser: glance
  debug:
    dbSync: false
    service: false
  preserveJobs: false
  replicas: 1
  storageRequest: 1G
  secret: glance-secret
  cephBackend:
    cephFsid: <ClusterFSID>
    cephMons: <CephMons>
    cephClientKey: <ClientKey>
    cephUser: <rbdUser>
    cephPools:
      cinder:
        name: volumes
      nova:
        name: vms
      glance:
        name: images
      cinder_backup:
        name: backup
      extra_pool1:
        name: ceph_ssd_tier
      extra_pool2:
        name: ceph_nvme_tier
      extra_pool3:
        name: ceph_hdd_tier
```

When the service is up and running, it's possible to interact with the glance
API and upload an image using the Ceph backend.


## Example2: pass Ceph credentials as secrets

When Glance is configured with a Ceph backend, it requires both ceph.conf and
the associated keyring.
Those files can be generated by an external entity and built as secrets in the
`openstack` namespace.

The following represents an example of secret that can be created:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-client-conf
  namespace: openstack
stringData:
  cluster1.client.<user>.keyring: |
    [client.<user>]
        key = <client_key>
        caps mgr = "allow *"
        caps mon = "profile rbd"
        caps osd = "profile rbd pool=images"
  cluster1.conf: |
    [global]
    fsid = <fsid>
    mon_host = <list_of_mon_ip>
```

Create the secret:

`oc create -f <secret_file>.yaml`


The operator can create several secrets according to the amount of Ceph
clusters available. The `CephSecret` key, that can be passed to the GlanceAPI
spec, is supposed to collect the secret names associated to each cluster, then
the glance-operator will be able to process the associated data and make them
available in /etc/ceph, which is the default location where the Ceph
credentials are stored. The following represents an example of Glance resource
that can be used to trigger the service deployment, and enable the rbd backend
that points to multiple external Ceph clusters.

```
apiVersion: glance.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: GlanceAPI
metadata:
  name: glance
spec:
  serviceUser: glance
  containerImage: quay.io/tripleotraincentos8/centos-binary-glance-api:current-tripleo
  customServiceConfig: |
    [DEFAULT]
    debug = true
    enabled_backends=ceph1:rbd,ceph2:rbd
    [ceph1]
    rbd_store_ceph_conf=/etc/ceph/ceph1.conf
    rbd_store_user=openstack
    rbd_store_pool=images
    store_description=Ceph glance store backend.
    [ceph2]
    rbd_store_ceph_conf=/etc/ceph/ceph2.conf
    rbd_store_user=openstack
    rbd_store_pool=images
    store_description=Ceph glance store backend.
    [glance_store]
    default_backend = ceph1
  databaseInstance: openstack
  databaseUser: glance
  debug:
    dbSync: false
    service: false
  preserveJobs: false
  replicas: 1
  storageRequest: 1G
  secret: glance-secret
  cephSecret:
    - cluster_secret1
    - cluster_secret2
```

When the service is up and running, it's possible to interact with the glance
API and upload an image using the configured Ceph backends.
